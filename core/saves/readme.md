## Can I delete 'saves' folder ?
This folder is not securise. If you delete saves python return you an fatal error so please don't do that , but you can delete saved partys in folders nammed : "saveXXXXXXXX" but when this folders been deleted we doesn't re load this save, and 'global' musn't delete for same reason than 'saves' but if you want you can delete the file 'global\globalScoreBoard.json' for clear manually the global scoreboard
